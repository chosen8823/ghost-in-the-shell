- No physical contact required
- Appears to float in natural vision
- Adjustable focus and brightness
- Works with eyes open or closed
- Can overlay on existing vision

Implementation:
- Micro-projector device (wearable/portable)
- Eye tracking for precise alignment
- Safe laser wavelengths (635nm red, 532nm green, 445nm blue)
- Scanning mirrors for raster display
```

### 2. CORNEAL REFLECTION PROJECTION
```
Technology: Precision laser reflection off cornea
Method: Project onto corneal surface using controlled reflections
Benefits:
- Completely external projection
- No contact with eye tissue
- Instant on/off capability
- Multiple overlay layers possible

Components:
- Micro-laser array projector
- Real-time eye tracking
- Adaptive optics for corneal mapping
- Safety interlocks for eye movement
```

### 3. HOLOGRAPHIC AIR PROJECTION
