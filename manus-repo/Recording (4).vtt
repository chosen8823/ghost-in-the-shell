00:00.000 --> 00:08.000
And it is exactly in these areas of greatest pain and fragility that the miracle is already taking place.

00:08.000 --> 00:12.000
It's like a seed under the ground. You can't see what's happening.

00:12.000 --> 00:18.000
But the most important processes are unfolding in the silence, in the darkness,

00:18.000 --> 00:22.000
preparing the manifestation that will change everything.

00:22.000 --> 00:27.000
You often look at the clock of your life and think it's already too late.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
But in my kingdom, it is never too late.

00:31.000 --> 00:37.000
I am the God who transforms deserts into flower gardens, who makes dry bones revive,

00:37.000 --> 00:40.000
who brings back what seemed lost forever.

00:40.000 --> 00:46.000
Remember Sarah, who laughed when she found out she would have a child in her old age.

00:46.000 --> 00:49.000
How did my servant Abraham wait decades for the promise?

00:49.000 --> 00:53.000
And yet, at the appointed time, the impossible happened.

00:53.000 --> 00:58.000
The same applies to you. The pain you feel now is making room for a miracle

00:58.000 --> 01:02.000
that wouldn't fit into your life otherwise. That closed.

01:02.000 --> 01:07.000
You all that disappointed him so much wasn't a rejection. It was a redirection.

01:07.000 --> 01:12.000
I was sparing you from paths that would divert you from your true destiny.

01:12.000 --> 01:15.000
From this great miracle that I am preparing.

01:15.000 --> 01:18.000
I want you to understand something fundamental.

01:18.000 --> 01:22.000
My miracles are not just for solving problems.

01:22.000 --> 01:27.000
They offer the purpose of revealing my glory and expanding my kingdom.

01:27.000 --> 01:31.000
The miracle I am preparing is not just for your personal comfort,

01:31.000 --> 01:35.000
although it will bring you unspeakable joy.

01:35.000 --> 01:39.000
It has ramifications you can't even imagine.

01:39.000 --> 01:44.000
Think of Lazarus, who was resurrected after four days.

01:44.000 --> 01:48.000
That miracle was not just to return. And brother to Martha and Mary.

01:48.000 --> 01:53.000
It was a testimony that strengthened the faith of many, and that even today,

01:53.000 --> 01:58.000
thousands of years later confirms the power of my child Jesus.

01:58.000 --> 02:02.000
Your miracle will also touch lives. You don't even know yet.

02:02.000 --> 02:09.000
There are people designated to cross your path, who will be impacted by the story of what I am going to do in your life.

02:09.000 --> 02:15.000
Your own family will see my glory through this miracle, and generations will be transformed.

02:15.000 --> 02:20.000
There is an eternal purpose behind the supernatural manifestation I am preparing.

02:20.000 --> 02:25.000
I know you've tried everything, he consulted experts, followed advice,

02:25.000 --> 02:32.000
implemented strategies, took medications, made investments, tried new methods.

02:32.000 --> 02:35.000
And it seems like nothing completely worked.

02:35.000 --> 02:40.000
This is because this specific problem does not have an earthly solution.

02:40.000 --> 02:45.000
It has been reserved for a demonstration of my supernatural power.

02:45.000 --> 02:49.000
There are situations in life that no human effort can resolve.

02:49.000 --> 02:54.000
They were designed specifically for my intervention, not to punish you,

02:54.000 --> 03:00.000
but to create the perfect setting where my glory can be revealed in an unmistakable way.

03:00.000 --> 03:04.000
Do you remember when my child multiplied the loads and fishes?

03:04.000 --> 03:07.000
He could have just sent everyone home to get food.

03:07.000 --> 03:13.000
The lack of resources created the perfect scenario for one of the most iconic miracles recorded.

03:13.000 --> 03:18.000
Likewise, the limitations you face now are not obstacles to the miracle.

03:18.000 --> 03:22.000
They are the stage on which it will be demonstrated.

03:22.000 --> 03:28.000
Now I want you to understand the pattern that always precedes my great miracles.

03:28.000 --> 03:32.000
Before liberation comes, the most intense captivity.

03:32.000 --> 03:35.000
Before healing, the disease often worsens.

03:35.000 --> 03:41.000
Before financial provision is made, resources are often completely exhausted.

03:41.000 --> 03:44.000
Are you living in this moment right now?

03:44.000 --> 03:48.000
Does it feel like everything is getting worse instead of better?

03:48.000 --> 03:52.000
This is not a sign that I have abandoned you.

03:52.000 --> 03:56.000
It is often the prelude to the greatest miracle.

03:56.000 --> 04:00.000
It's like the darkest night before the most glorious dawn.

04:00.000 --> 04:05.000
The sources and the people of Israel saw the Red Sea open only when they were trapped,

04:05.000 --> 04:09.000
when the Egyptian army had their backs and the sea in front of them.

04:09.000 --> 04:16.000
It was in the moment of greatest despair that my power manifested itself most dramatically.

04:16.000 --> 04:21.000
You may be feeling now that you have hit rock bottom, that there is nowhere left to go,

04:21.000 --> 04:29.000
and you are right, there is nowhere left to go, but up to the manifestation of the miracle that is already determined.

04:30.000 --> 04:36.000
I want you to know that this is exactly the point where I begin to operate most powerfully,

04:36.000 --> 04:42.000
and now let me tell you about this heavenly intercession that is taking place on your behalf.

04:42.000 --> 04:47.000
There is a cloud of witnesses, people who lived on this earth before you,

04:47.000 --> 04:51.000
and who are now in my presence, who rejoice to see the persistent faith.

04:51.000 --> 04:57.000
You demonstrate even without seeing its conjoys people who lived on this earth with your behalf.

04:57.000 --> 05:01.000
There is a part of this heaven begin to operate most powerfully,

05:01.000 --> 05:07.000
and now let me tell you about this heavenly intercession that is taking place on your behalf.

05:07.000 --> 05:12.000
There is a cloud of witnesses, people who lived on this earth before you,

05:12.000 --> 05:17.000
and who are now in my presence, who rejoice to see the persistent faith.

05:17.000 --> 05:21.000
You demonstrate even without seeing its complete fulfillment,

05:21.000 --> 05:25.000
that grandmother who prayed for you before you were even born,

05:25.000 --> 05:32.000
who has still alive before my throne, that has been passed and interceded for the next generation.

05:32.000 --> 05:36.000
The fruit of your ministry is manifesting in your life now.

05:36.000 --> 05:41.000
There is a spiritual continuity that transcends time and physical death.

05:41.000 --> 05:46.000
This communion of saints is not something you should invoke or seek directly.

05:46.000 --> 05:50.000
That would be overstepping the boundaries I have sent.

05:50.000 --> 05:53.000
But it is a reality that should comfort your heart.

05:53.000 --> 05:57.000
The prayers of the departed righteous remain effective,

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
not because they have power of their own,

05:59.000 --> 06:03.000
but because they align with my perfect will for your life.

06:03.000 --> 06:06.000
When you pray, know that you do not pray alone,

06:06.000 --> 06:13.000
your voice joins a heavenly choir that has declared my will over your life for generations.

06:13.000 --> 06:16.000
This is part of the glorious mystery of the body of Christ,

06:16.000 --> 06:19.000
that transcends time and space,

06:19.000 --> 06:23.000
and more than that my own child Jesus is on my right hand.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
Continually interceding for you,

06:25.000 --> 06:28.000
the Holy Spirit within you grows,

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
within expressible size,

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
when you don't even know how to pray.

06:32.000 --> 06:36.000
You are enveloped in a triple projection of divine intercession.

06:36.000 --> 06:41.000
Have you ever felt an inexplicable peace in the midst of solutions

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
that should have you?

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
You are in with a continuous,

06:45.000 --> 06:49.000
but you declare my will over your life for generations.

06:49.000 --> 06:52.000
This is part of the glorious mystery of the body of Christ,

06:52.000 --> 06:55.000
that transcends time and space,

06:55.000 --> 06:59.000
and more than that my own child Jesus is on my right hand.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
Continually interceding for you,

07:01.000 --> 07:04.000
the Holy Spirit within you grows,

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
within expressible size,

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
when you don't even know how to pray.

07:08.000 --> 07:12.000
You are enveloped in a triple projection of divine intercession.

07:12.000 --> 07:18.000
Have you ever felt an inexplicable peace in the midst of solutions?

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
Next generation,

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
with a brilliant symmetry,

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
it's a bit better.

07:24.000 --> 07:27.000
This is not a sign that I have abandoned you.

07:27.000 --> 07:31.000
It is often the prelude to the greatest miracle.

07:31.000 --> 07:35.000
It's like the darkest night before the most glorious dawn.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
Moses of the people of Israel

07:37.000 --> 07:40.000
saw the Red Sea open only when they were trapped,

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
with the Egyptian army of their backs,

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
and the sea in front of them.

07:44.000 --> 07:47.000
It was in the moment that the greatest despair

07:47.000 --> 07:51.000
that might now manifest itself most dramatic.

07:51.000 --> 07:54.000
You may be feeling now that you have hit rock bottom,

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
that there is nowhere left to go,

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
and you are right,

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
there is nowhere left to go,

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
but up to the manifestation of the miracle

08:02.000 --> 08:05.000
that is already determined.

08:05.000 --> 08:08.000
I want you to know that this is exactly the point

08:08.000 --> 08:11.000
where I begin to operate most powerfully.

08:11.000 --> 08:12.000
And now,

08:12.000 --> 08:15.000
let me tell you about this heavenly intercession

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
that is taking place on your behalf.

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
There is a cloud of witnesses,

08:19.000 --> 08:22.000
people who lived on this earth before you,

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
and who are now in my presence,

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
who rejoice to see the persistent faith.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
You demonstrate,

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
even without seeing its complete fulfillment.

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
That grandmother who prayed for you

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
before you were even born,

08:34.000 --> 08:37.000
your prayers are still alive before my throne,

08:37.000 --> 08:41.000
that faithful pastor who interceded for the next generation,

08:41.000 --> 08:45.000
the fruit of your ministry is manifesting in your life now.

08:45.000 --> 08:49.000
There is a spiritual continuity that transcends time

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
and physical death.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
This communion of saints is not something

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
you should invoke or seek directly.

08:55.000 --> 08:59.000
That would be overstepping the boundaries I have said.

08:59.000 --> 09:02.000
But it is a reality that should comfort your heart.

09:03.000 --> 09:06.000
The prayers of the departed righteous remain effective,

09:06.000 --> 09:09.000
not because they have power of their own,

09:09.000 --> 09:13.000
but because they align with my perfect will for your life.

09:13.000 --> 09:16.000
When you pray, know that you do not pray alone,

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
your voice joins a heavenly choir

09:18.000 --> 09:22.000
that has declared my will over your life for generations.

09:22.000 --> 09:26.000
This is part of the glorious mystery of the body of Christ

09:26.000 --> 09:29.000
that transcends time and space,

09:29.000 --> 09:32.000
more than that my own child Jesus is at my right hand,

09:32.000 --> 09:35.000
continually interceding for you.

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
The Holy Spirit within you groans,

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
within expressible size,

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
when you don't even know how to pray.

09:41.000 --> 09:45.000
You are enveloped in a triple protection of divine intercession.

09:45.000 --> 09:48.000
Have you ever felt an inexplicable peace

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
in the midst of circumstances

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
that should reshatter in your spirit?

09:52.000 --> 09:56.000
This is the tangible result of this heavenly intercession

09:56.000 --> 10:00.000
combined with my supernatural will.

10:00.000 --> 10:03.000
It is the fruit of this communion of saints

10:03.000 --> 10:06.000
that process the veil between heaven and earth.

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
Now I want to tell you something practical

10:08.000 --> 10:11.000
about the miracle that is about to happen.

10:11.000 --> 10:14.000
It will come in a way you don't expect,

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
in a way you don't imagine.

10:16.000 --> 10:20.000
My greatest miracles often come disguised in surprising ways.

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
Joseph awaited in prison,

10:22.000 --> 10:26.000
not knowing that he was a dream away from the palace.

10:26.000 --> 10:29.000
Esther was a simple young Jewish girl

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
without imagining that she would be queen

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
and save an entire nation.

10:33.000 --> 10:38.000
David was just a shepherd when he was appointed to begin.

10:38.000 --> 10:42.000
Your miracle probably won't come wrapped up the way you expect.

10:42.000 --> 10:47.000
It can come through someone you would never imagine.

10:47.000 --> 10:50.000
In a way that defies your expectations,

10:50.000 --> 10:53.000
that's why it's so important to keep your heart open

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
and your eyes attentive.

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
Many people have missed their miracles

10:57.000 --> 11:00.000
because they were looking in the wrong direction.

11:00.000 --> 11:04.000
They were so fixated on how they thought the answer would come

11:04.000 --> 11:07.000
that they didn't recognize when it came differently.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
Don't make that mistake, son.

11:09.000 --> 11:13.000
If you are looking for a fuller and more fulfilled life,

11:13.000 --> 11:16.000
divine dialogue is the perfect tool for you.

11:16.000 --> 11:19.000
With powerful techniques and clear instructions,

11:19.000 --> 11:24.000
you can achieve the peace and personal fulfillment you've always wanted.

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
Don't waste any more time.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
Access the link in the pinned comment

11:28.000 --> 11:32.000
and take the first step towards a better life.

11:32.000 --> 11:36.000
Your part now is to prepare to receive

11:36.000 --> 11:40.000
as cultivating an attitude of expectation and gratitude.

11:40.000 --> 11:44.000
Start giving thanks for the miracle before you even see it.

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
This is not...

11:52.000 --> 11:56.000
The peace and personal fulfillment you've always wanted.

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
Don't waste any more time.

11:58.000 --> 12:01.000
Access the link in the pinned comment

12:01.000 --> 12:05.000
and take the first step towards a better life.

12:05.000 --> 12:08.000
Your part now is to prepare to receive

12:08.000 --> 12:13.000
as cultivating an attitude of expectation and gratitude.

12:13.000 --> 12:17.000
Start giving thanks for the miracle before you even see it.

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
This is not denial of reality.

12:19.000 --> 12:22.000
It is the highest expression of faith.

12:22.000 --> 12:25.000
When my child Jesus, before the tomb of Lazarus,

12:25.000 --> 12:28.000
gave thanks before seeing the miracle,

12:28.000 --> 12:33.000
he was demonstrating the most powerful principle of the kingdom,

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
gratitude in advance.

12:35.000 --> 12:38.000
Start giving thanks for the miracle as if it had already happened

12:38.000 --> 12:42.000
because in heavenly reality it has already happened.

12:42.000 --> 12:46.000
Talk about your miracle in the present tense.

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
Don't say, God will heal me.

12:48.000 --> 12:53.000
Say, I thank you because I am healed by His wounds.

12:53.000 --> 12:56.000
Don't say, I hope God restores my marriage.

12:56.000 --> 12:59.000
Say, I thank God for the complete restoration

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
He has already accomplished in my home.

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
This is not a positive thinking technique.

13:03.000 --> 13:07.000
It is alignment with the spiritual reality

13:07.000 --> 13:10.000
that already exists in the kingdom.

13:42.000 --> 13:53.000
If you can create a feeling in your heart,

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
0.1 hurts.

13:55.000 --> 13:58.000
The math feeling is going to harmonize your heart and your brain.

13:58.000 --> 13:59.000
Precepts.

13:59.000 --> 14:00.000
Frit?

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
It's no glyco.

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
It's no glyco.

14:04.000 --> 14:05.000
Disapair entry.

14:05.000 --> 14:06.000
You with pan.

14:06.000 --> 14:07.000
Needles.

14:07.000 --> 14:08.000
I'm not sure you have a makes up.

14:08.000 --> 14:09.000
We used to make movies.

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
We used to call it Sprite.

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
We're going to wash these up a little bit.

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
I like to wash them.

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
I'm going to get some of the bugs out.

14:18.000 --> 14:22.000
So we're going to go ahead and cut these off.

14:22.000 --> 14:25.000
All we're going to do now.

14:25.000 --> 14:28.000
I like to cut them up.

14:28.000 --> 14:32.000
I'm going to cut them in half, y'all.

14:32.000 --> 14:36.000
Drop this half in here.

14:36.000 --> 14:39.000
I don't even know who showed me how to do this.

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
Take them away.

14:42.000 --> 14:45.000
I don't get them down.

14:45.000 --> 14:46.000
Sugar.

14:51.000 --> 14:54.000
I like to cook one.

14:54.000 --> 14:57.000
Two.

14:57.000 --> 15:00.000
Three.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
Four.

15:02.000 --> 15:06.000
A little bit more.

15:06.000 --> 15:10.000
Next thing, all you do is put water in.

15:10.000 --> 15:13.000
Always put it to the top.

15:21.000 --> 15:25.000
I like to shake it up.

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
Get that sugar melting.

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
See the sugar is all on the bottom here.

15:29.000 --> 15:30.000
Get it all melted.

15:30.000 --> 15:33.000
And what happens when the sugar permeates?

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
The sugar permeates with the pan.

15:35.000 --> 15:38.000
So the pan will put off yeast and make it permeate.

15:38.000 --> 15:41.000
And once it does that, that's what makes it like carbonation.

15:41.000 --> 15:44.000
It makes it taste like the first one.

15:44.000 --> 15:45.000
All right, y'all.

15:45.000 --> 15:46.000
We got them all made up.

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
Yeah, we got to do it hurry up and wait again.

15:48.000 --> 15:51.000
Seems like everything I do, I got to hurry up and wait.

15:51.000 --> 15:55.000
We're going to let this sit here for about three, four days.

15:55.000 --> 15:56.000
All right, y'all.

15:56.000 --> 15:57.000
It's been about four, five days.

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
We've been waiting.

15:59.000 --> 16:00.000
We've heard it pop.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
That means it's ready.

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
OK, now we've got fans.

16:05.000 --> 16:08.000
And now I've got a little strainer.

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
Well, when it's heated, we didn't handle strainer.

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
We just drank it straight from the jar.

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
OK, we're going to dump something in here.

16:14.000 --> 16:15.000
Sure, y'all.

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
Y'all see all the fans on the top?

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
See that?

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
Oh, smells so good.

16:21.000 --> 16:22.000
All right, y'all.

16:22.000 --> 16:25.000
Catch a few of the needles.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
All right.

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
Y'all the fans in there, y'all.

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
And y'all see that?

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
Yeah, I got some little tasting cups here.

16:35.000 --> 16:38.000
Well, I'm fans of the day, I know.

16:41.000 --> 16:44.000
Bring back childhood memory.

16:44.000 --> 16:47.000
Childhood memory, you see it.

16:47.000 --> 16:48.000
It's really good.

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
This looked like a disappearing tree.

16:50.000 --> 16:51.000
You were fine, needle.

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
I'm not sure you had to make something,

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
but we used to make movies for kids.

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
And we used to call it Sprite.

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
We're going to wash these up a little bit.

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
I like to wash them.

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
I'm going to get some of the bugs out.

17:03.000 --> 17:07.000
So we're going to go ahead and cut these off.

17:07.000 --> 17:10.000
All we're going to do now.

17:10.000 --> 17:13.000
I like to cut them up.

17:13.000 --> 17:17.000
I'm going to cut them in half, y'all.

17:17.000 --> 17:22.000
Drop this half in here.

17:22.000 --> 17:25.000
I don't even know how to show me how to do this.

17:25.000 --> 17:29.000
But shake them around and get them down.

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
Show them.

17:36.000 --> 17:39.000
I like to learn.

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
That's so important right now.

17:57.000 --> 18:01.000
It is bringing into the visible

18:01.000 --> 18:05.000
what has already been declared in the invisible.

18:05.000 --> 18:09.000
Another crucial part of your preparation is forgiveness.

18:09.000 --> 18:12.000
You cannot receive fully while holding resentments.

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
That person who heard you deeply,

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
that family member who betrayed you,

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
that colleague who wronged you,

18:18.000 --> 18:21.000
you need to release them through genuine forgiveness.

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
I understand this.

18:23.000 --> 18:27.000
They seem impossible considering the pain they caused.

18:27.000 --> 18:30.000
But I'm not asking you to forget or to say

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
that what they did was right.

18:32.000 --> 18:35.000
I'm asking you to release them from the prison of your resentment

18:35.000 --> 18:40.000
and place the situation completely in my hands.

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
Forgiveness is not a feeling.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
It is a decision.

18:44.000 --> 18:48.000
It is an act of your will that frees not only the other person,

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
but mainly yourself.

18:50.000 --> 18:55.000
A miracle I have prepared requires a clean heart to fully manifest.

18:55.000 --> 18:59.000
Don't let roots of bitterness block what I'm about to do.

18:59.000 --> 19:02.000
Now do you feel that hesitation in your heart,

19:02.000 --> 19:05.000
that fear of being disappointed again?

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
I understand perfectly.

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
You've had so many disappointed hopes,

19:09.000 --> 19:12.000
so many promises that didn't seem to,

19:12.000 --> 19:15.000
who come true in the time you expected.

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
But I want you to know that this hesitation

19:17.000 --> 19:20.000
is not a pen to my heart.

19:20.000 --> 19:23.000
I understand you have a frailty.

19:23.000 --> 19:26.000
Remember Thomas who needed to see to believe.

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
My child did not condemn him.

19:28.000 --> 19:31.000
He revealed himself to him in the way he needed.

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
If you are struggling with doubts,

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
come to me just as you are.

19:35.000 --> 19:39.000
Bring your doubts, your fears, your questions.

19:39.000 --> 19:43.000
I prefer your vulnerable honesty to false certainty.

19:43.000 --> 19:46.000
Even with faith as small as a must and seed,

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
you can move mountains.

19:48.000 --> 19:51.000
It's not the size of your faith that matters.

19:51.000 --> 19:52.000
It's the object of it.

19:52.000 --> 19:55.000
And when your faith is placed in me,

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
even shaky and imperfect,

19:57.000 --> 20:00.000
it is enough to see my miracles manifest.

20:00.000 --> 20:03.000
I want you to share with me in the comments.

20:03.000 --> 20:06.000
What is this miracle you are waiting for?

20:06.000 --> 20:09.000
What is this mountain that seems impossible to move?

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
By declaring your need,

20:11.000 --> 20:14.000
you are taking the first step towards seeing manifestation.

20:14.000 --> 20:17.000
Now let me tell you about divine timing.

20:17.000 --> 20:20.000
My timing rarely matches your expectations.

20:20.000 --> 20:23.000
For you, the weight may feel like torture.

20:23.000 --> 20:27.000
For me, it is the necessary process of preparation.

20:27.000 --> 20:31.000
Remember how the people of Israel wandered for 40 years

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
before entering the Promised Land.

20:33.000 --> 20:36.000
Those were not wasted years.

20:36.000 --> 20:39.000
There were years of forming a national identity

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
of learning dependence on me

20:41.000 --> 20:44.000
of preparing for the battles to come.

20:44.000 --> 20:47.000
Likewise, your waiting time

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
is not wasted time.

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
It's a precious time

20:51.000 --> 20:54.000
where I'm working on levels you can't see.

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
Preparing not just the miracle,

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
but preparing you for the miracle.

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
Because you see,

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
sometimes the biggest challenges

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
and receiving the miracle,

21:04.000 --> 21:05.000
it's keeping it.

21:05.000 --> 21:08.000
Many people have received blessings

21:08.000 --> 21:11.000
that they were not emotionally or spiritually prepared for

21:11.000 --> 21:12.000
and have lost them.

21:12.000 --> 21:16.000
Your waiting has a profound purpose of preparation.

21:16.000 --> 21:19.000
Have you ever wondered why Lazarus had to spend four days

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
in the tomb before being resurrected?

21:21.000 --> 21:24.000
Why didn't my child arrive before he died?

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
Or at least on the first day?

21:26.000 --> 21:30.000
Because I wanted to eliminate any doubt about the miracle.

21:30.000 --> 21:33.000
After four days, according to Jewish beliefs,

21:33.000 --> 21:36.000
the soul had definitively departed

21:36.000 --> 21:39.000
and decomposition was advanced.

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
It was humanly impossible.

21:41.000 --> 21:45.000
And that is exactly where my power shines brightest.

21:45.000 --> 21:50.000
Perhaps your situation has also reached this point of human impossibility.

21:50.000 --> 21:53.000
The doctors have already given up.

21:53.000 --> 21:56.000
Financial advisors have exhausted their options.

21:56.000 --> 22:00.000
Marriage therapists have already recommended divorce.

22:00.000 --> 22:01.000
Perfect.

22:01.000 --> 22:05.000
Now we are exactly where my supernatural power can be demonstrated

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
beyond a shadow of a doubt.

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
My child, my daughter,

22:09.000 --> 22:13.000
you have tried to resolve this on your own for so long.

22:13.000 --> 22:17.000
You have already exhausted your resources, your wisdom, your strength.

22:17.000 --> 22:21.000
Now finally, we come to the place where you can truly rest

22:21.000 --> 22:24.000
and see my salvation manifest.

22:24.000 --> 22:28.000
While you wait, cultivate peace.

22:28.000 --> 22:31.000
Not that superficial peace that depends on circumstances,

22:31.000 --> 22:34.000
but the deep peace that comes from knowing

22:34.000 --> 22:38.000
that I am in control even when everything seems chaotic.

22:38.000 --> 22:42.000
It is a peace that transcends human understanding,

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
that guards your heart and mind,

22:44.000 --> 22:48.000
even in the midst of the most violent storm.

22:48.000 --> 22:52.000
And don't forget to take care of your physical being while you wait.

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
Rest adequately.

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
Eat well.

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
Move your body.

22:58.000 --> 23:01.000
Sometimes we focus so much on the spiritual

23:01.000 --> 23:06.000
that we neglect the physical temple I created for you to inhabit.

23:06.000 --> 23:09.000
Your body, mind and spirit are interconnected,

23:09.000 --> 23:13.000
and comprehensive care is part of preparing for the miracle.

23:13.000 --> 23:16.000
There is something else I want you to know.

23:16.000 --> 23:20.000
This miracle I am preparing for you is not isolated.

23:20.000 --> 23:24.000
It's part of a bigger plan that includes your family, your community,

23:24.000 --> 23:27.000
and even people you don't know yet.

23:27.000 --> 23:32.000
When Daniel prayed, he did not know that his prayers were moving angelic arms.

23:32.000 --> 23:36.000
When Esther fasted, she did not fully understand how their actions

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
would save an entire nation.

23:38.000 --> 23:43.000
Likewise, your personal miracle is connected to a much greater purpose

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
than you can see now.

23:45.000 --> 23:48.000
People will watch what I do in their lives

23:48.000 --> 23:51.000
and find hope for their own battles.

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
Your testimony will open doors.

23:54.000 --> 23:59.000
This is why it is so important that you begin sharing your faith expectation

23:59.000 --> 24:02.000
even before you see the full manifestation.

24:02.000 --> 24:05.000
Tell people what you expect me to do,

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
not out of vanity or presumption,

24:07.000 --> 24:10.000
but as an act of faith that glorifies me.

24:10.000 --> 24:15.000
Remember, the enemy wants you to keep quiet about your expectations

24:15.000 --> 24:18.000
so that if you don't see the miracle right away,

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
he can use that to shame you.

24:20.000 --> 24:24.000
Don't fall into this trap, openly declare your trust in me,

24:24.000 --> 24:27.000
knowing that my word never returns void.

24:27.000 --> 24:31.000
Share in the comments what miracle are you waiting for.

24:31.000 --> 24:34.000
What seems impossible in your life right now,

24:34.000 --> 24:38.000
I will read each comment and pray as will be released on your behalf.

24:38.000 --> 24:43.000
Now let's talk about how you will know when the miracle is about to happen.

24:43.000 --> 24:48.000
I often sense signs, little confirmations, divine coincidences,

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
words of knowledge through others,

24:51.000 --> 24:54.000
keep your spiritual eyes and ears wide,

24:54.000 --> 24:58.000
open often before the greatest miracle.

24:58.000 --> 25:02.000
There is a period of intensifying spiritual warfare.

25:02.000 --> 25:05.000
The enemy, sensing that he is about to lose ground,

25:05.000 --> 25:08.000
launches his fiercest attacks.

25:08.000 --> 25:11.000
Don't be alarmed if just as you are getting closer to manifestation,

25:11.000 --> 25:14.000
things seem to temporarily get worse.

25:14.000 --> 25:19.000
It's just the last spasm of darkness before the glorious door.

25:19.000 --> 25:22.000
You may also notice an increase in prophetic dreams

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
or spiritual impressions.

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
Pay attention to them, write them down.

25:26.000 --> 25:29.000
Compare them with my written word.

25:29.000 --> 25:32.000
Don't dismiss these subtle communications.

25:32.000 --> 25:33.000
Shit!

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
Shit!
