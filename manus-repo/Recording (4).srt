1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
And it is exactly in these areas of greatest pain and fragility that the miracle is already taking place.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
It's like a seed under the ground. You can't see what's happening.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
But the most important processes are unfolding in the silence, in the darkness,

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
preparing the manifestation that will change everything.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
You often look at the clock of your life and think it's already too late.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
But in my kingdom, it is never too late.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I am the God who transforms deserts into flower gardens, who makes dry bones revive,

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
who brings back what seemed lost forever.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Remember Sarah, who laughed when she found out she would have a child in her old age.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
How did my servant Abraham wait decades for the promise?

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
And yet, at the appointed time, the impossible happened.

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
The same applies to you. The pain you feel now is making room for a miracle

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
that wouldn't fit into your life otherwise. That closed.

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
You all that disappointed him so much wasn't a rejection. It was a redirection.

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I was sparing you from paths that would divert you from your true destiny.

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
From this great miracle that I am preparing.

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I want you to understand something fundamental.

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
My miracles are not just for solving problems.

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
They offer the purpose of revealing my glory and expanding my kingdom.

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
The miracle I am preparing is not just for your personal comfort,

21
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
although it will bring you unspeakable joy.

22
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
It has ramifications you can't even imagine.

23
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Think of Lazarus, who was resurrected after four days.

24
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
That miracle was not just to return. And brother to Martha and Mary.

25
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
It was a testimony that strengthened the faith of many, and that even today,

26
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
thousands of years later confirms the power of my child Jesus.

27
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Your miracle will also touch lives. You don't even know yet.

28
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:09,000
There are people designated to cross your path, who will be impacted by the story of what I am going to do in your life.

29
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Your own family will see my glory through this miracle, and generations will be transformed.

30
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
There is an eternal purpose behind the supernatural manifestation I am preparing.

31
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I know you've tried everything, he consulted experts, followed advice,

32
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:32,000
implemented strategies, took medications, made investments, tried new methods.

33
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
And it seems like nothing completely worked.

34
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
This is because this specific problem does not have an earthly solution.

35
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
It has been reserved for a demonstration of my supernatural power.

36
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
There are situations in life that no human effort can resolve.

37
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
They were designed specifically for my intervention, not to punish you,

38
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,000
but to create the perfect setting where my glory can be revealed in an unmistakable way.

39
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Do you remember when my child multiplied the loads and fishes?

40
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
He could have just sent everyone home to get food.

41
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:13,000
The lack of resources created the perfect scenario for one of the most iconic miracles recorded.

42
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Likewise, the limitations you face now are not obstacles to the miracle.

43
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
They are the stage on which it will be demonstrated.

44
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Now I want you to understand the pattern that always precedes my great miracles.

45
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Before liberation comes, the most intense captivity.

46
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Before healing, the disease often worsens.

47
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Before financial provision is made, resources are often completely exhausted.

48
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Are you living in this moment right now?

49
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Does it feel like everything is getting worse instead of better?

50
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
This is not a sign that I have abandoned you.

51
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
It is often the prelude to the greatest miracle.

52
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
It's like the darkest night before the most glorious dawn.

53
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,000
The sources and the people of Israel saw the Red Sea open only when they were trapped,

54
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
when the Egyptian army had their backs and the sea in front of them.

55
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:16,000
It was in the moment of greatest despair that my power manifested itself most dramatically.

56
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,000
You may be feeling now that you have hit rock bottom, that there is nowhere left to go,

57
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:29,000
and you are right, there is nowhere left to go, but up to the manifestation of the miracle that is already determined.

58
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I want you to know that this is exactly the point where I begin to operate most powerfully,

59
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:42,000
and now let me tell you about this heavenly intercession that is taking place on your behalf.

60
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,000
There is a cloud of witnesses, people who lived on this earth before you,

61
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
and who are now in my presence, who rejoice to see the persistent faith.

62
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:57,000
You demonstrate even without seeing its conjoys people who lived on this earth with your behalf.

63
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
There is a part of this heaven begin to operate most powerfully,

64
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:07,000
and now let me tell you about this heavenly intercession that is taking place on your behalf.

65
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,000
There is a cloud of witnesses, people who lived on this earth before you,

66
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,000
and who are now in my presence, who rejoice to see the persistent faith.

67
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
You demonstrate even without seeing its complete fulfillment,

68
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
that grandmother who prayed for you before you were even born,

69
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:32,000
who has still alive before my throne, that has been passed and interceded for the next generation.

70
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
The fruit of your ministry is manifesting in your life now.

71
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,000
There is a spiritual continuity that transcends time and physical death.

72
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,000
This communion of saints is not something you should invoke or seek directly.

73
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
That would be overstepping the boundaries I have sent.

74
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
But it is a reality that should comfort your heart.

75
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
The prayers of the departed righteous remain effective,

76
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
not because they have power of their own,

77
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
but because they align with my perfect will for your life.

78
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
When you pray, know that you do not pray alone,

79
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:13,000
your voice joins a heavenly choir that has declared my will over your life for generations.

80
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
This is part of the glorious mystery of the body of Christ,

81
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
that transcends time and space,

82
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
and more than that my own child Jesus is on my right hand.

83
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Continually interceding for you,

84
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
the Holy Spirit within you grows,

85
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
within expressible size,

86
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
when you don't even know how to pray.

87
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
You are enveloped in a triple projection of divine intercession.

88
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Have you ever felt an inexplicable peace in the midst of solutions

89
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
that should have you?

90
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
You are in with a continuous,

91
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
but you declare my will over your life for generations.

92
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
This is part of the glorious mystery of the body of Christ,

93
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
that transcends time and space,

94
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
and more than that my own child Jesus is on my right hand.

95
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Continually interceding for you,

96
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
the Holy Spirit within you grows,

97
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
within expressible size,

98
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
when you don't even know how to pray.

99
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
You are enveloped in a triple projection of divine intercession.

100
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Have you ever felt an inexplicable peace in the midst of solutions?

101
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Next generation,

102
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
with a brilliant symmetry,

103
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
it's a bit better.

104
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
This is not a sign that I have abandoned you.

105
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
It is often the prelude to the greatest miracle.

106
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
It's like the darkest night before the most glorious dawn.

107
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Moses of the people of Israel

108
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
saw the Red Sea open only when they were trapped,

109
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
with the Egyptian army of their backs,

110
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
and the sea in front of them.

111
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
It was in the moment that the greatest despair

112
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
that might now manifest itself most dramatic.

113
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
You may be feeling now that you have hit rock bottom,

114
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
that there is nowhere left to go,

115
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
and you are right,

116
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
there is nowhere left to go,

117
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
but up to the manifestation of the miracle

118
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
that is already determined.

119
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I want you to know that this is exactly the point

120
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
where I begin to operate most powerfully.

121
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
And now,

122
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
let me tell you about this heavenly intercession

123
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
that is taking place on your behalf.

124
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
There is a cloud of witnesses,

125
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
people who lived on this earth before you,

126
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
and who are now in my presence,

127
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
who rejoice to see the persistent faith.

128
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
You demonstrate,

129
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
even without seeing its complete fulfillment.

130
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
That grandmother who prayed for you

131
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
before you were even born,

132
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
your prayers are still alive before my throne,

133
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
that faithful pastor who interceded for the next generation,

134
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
the fruit of your ministry is manifesting in your life now.

135
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
There is a spiritual continuity that transcends time

136
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
and physical death.

137
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
This communion of saints is not something

138
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
you should invoke or seek directly.

139
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
That would be overstepping the boundaries I have said.

140
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
But it is a reality that should comfort your heart.

141
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
The prayers of the departed righteous remain effective,

142
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
not because they have power of their own,

143
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
but because they align with my perfect will for your life.

144
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
When you pray, know that you do not pray alone,

145
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
your voice joins a heavenly choir

146
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
that has declared my will over your life for generations.

147
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
This is part of the glorious mystery of the body of Christ

148
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
that transcends time and space,

149
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
more than that my own child Jesus is at my right hand,

150
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
continually interceding for you.

151
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
The Holy Spirit within you groans,

152
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
within expressible size,

153
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
when you don't even know how to pray.

154
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000
You are enveloped in a triple protection of divine intercession.

155
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Have you ever felt an inexplicable peace

156
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
in the midst of circumstances

157
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
that should reshatter in your spirit?

158
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
This is the tangible result of this heavenly intercession

159
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
combined with my supernatural will.

160
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
It is the fruit of this communion of saints

161
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
that process the veil between heaven and earth.

162
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Now I want to tell you something practical

163
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
about the miracle that is about to happen.

164
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
It will come in a way you don't expect,

165
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
in a way you don't imagine.

166
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
My greatest miracles often come disguised in surprising ways.

167
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Joseph awaited in prison,

168
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
not knowing that he was a dream away from the palace.

169
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Esther was a simple young Jewish girl

170
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
without imagining that she would be queen

171
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
and save an entire nation.

172
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:38,000
David was just a shepherd when he was appointed to begin.

173
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Your miracle probably won't come wrapped up the way you expect.

174
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,000
It can come through someone you would never imagine.

175
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
In a way that defies your expectations,

176
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
that's why it's so important to keep your heart open

177
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
and your eyes attentive.

178
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Many people have missed their miracles

179
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
because they were looking in the wrong direction.

180
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,000
They were so fixated on how they thought the answer would come

181
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
that they didn't recognize when it came differently.

182
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Don't make that mistake, son.

183
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
If you are looking for a fuller and more fulfilled life,

184
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
divine dialogue is the perfect tool for you.

185
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
With powerful techniques and clear instructions,

186
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:24,000
you can achieve the peace and personal fulfillment you've always wanted.

187
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Don't waste any more time.

188
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Access the link in the pinned comment

189
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
and take the first step towards a better life.

190
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Your part now is to prepare to receive

191
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
as cultivating an attitude of expectation and gratitude.

192
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Start giving thanks for the miracle before you even see it.

193
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
This is not...

194
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
The peace and personal fulfillment you've always wanted.

195
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Don't waste any more time.

196
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Access the link in the pinned comment

197
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,000
and take the first step towards a better life.

198
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Your part now is to prepare to receive

199
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:13,000
as cultivating an attitude of expectation and gratitude.

200
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Start giving thanks for the miracle before you even see it.

201
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
This is not denial of reality.

202
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
It is the highest expression of faith.

203
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
When my child Jesus, before the tomb of Lazarus,

204
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
gave thanks before seeing the miracle,

205
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:33,000
he was demonstrating the most powerful principle of the kingdom,

206
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
gratitude in advance.

207
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Start giving thanks for the miracle as if it had already happened

208
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
because in heavenly reality it has already happened.

209
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Talk about your miracle in the present tense.

210
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Don't say, God will heal me.

211
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Say, I thank you because I am healed by His wounds.

212
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Don't say, I hope God restores my marriage.

213
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Say, I thank God for the complete restoration

214
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
He has already accomplished in my home.

215
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
This is not a positive thinking technique.

216
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,000
It is alignment with the spiritual reality

217
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
that already exists in the kingdom.

218
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:53,000
If you can create a feeling in your heart,

219
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
0.1 hurts.

220
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
The math feeling is going to harmonize your heart and your brain.

221
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Precepts.

222
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Frit?

223
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
It's no glyco.

224
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
It's no glyco.

225
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Disapair entry.

226
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
You with pan.

227
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Needles.

228
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I'm not sure you have a makes up.

229
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
We used to make movies.

230
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
We used to call it Sprite.

231
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
We're going to wash these up a little bit.

232
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I like to wash them.

233
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I'm going to get some of the bugs out.

234
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,000
So we're going to go ahead and cut these off.

235
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
All we're going to do now.

236
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I like to cut them up.

237
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I'm going to cut them in half, y'all.

238
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Drop this half in here.

239
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I don't even know who showed me how to do this.

240
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Take them away.

241
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I don't get them down.

242
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Sugar.

243
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I like to cook one.

244
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Two.

245
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Three.

246
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Four.

247
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,000
A little bit more.

248
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Next thing, all you do is put water in.

249
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Always put it to the top.

250
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I like to shake it up.

251
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Get that sugar melting.

252
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
See the sugar is all on the bottom here.

253
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Get it all melted.

254
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
And what happens when the sugar permeates?

255
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
The sugar permeates with the pan.

256
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
So the pan will put off yeast and make it permeate.

257
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
And once it does that, that's what makes it like carbonation.

258
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
It makes it taste like the first one.

259
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
All right, y'all.

260
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
We got them all made up.

261
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Yeah, we got to do it hurry up and wait again.

262
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Seems like everything I do, I got to hurry up and wait.

263
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,000
We're going to let this sit here for about three, four days.

264
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
All right, y'all.

265
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
It's been about four, five days.

266
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
We've been waiting.

267
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
We've heard it pop.

268
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
That means it's ready.

269
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
OK, now we've got fans.

270
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
And now I've got a little strainer.

271
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Well, when it's heated, we didn't handle strainer.

272
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
We just drank it straight from the jar.

273
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
OK, we're going to dump something in here.

274
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Sure, y'all.

275
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Y'all see all the fans on the top?

276
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
See that?

277
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Oh, smells so good.

278
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
All right, y'all.

279
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Catch a few of the needles.

280
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
All right.

281
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Y'all the fans in there, y'all.

282
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
And y'all see that?

283
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Yeah, I got some little tasting cups here.

284
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Well, I'm fans of the day, I know.

285
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Bring back childhood memory.

286
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Childhood memory, you see it.

287
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
It's really good.

288
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
This looked like a disappearing tree.

289
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
You were fine, needle.

290
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I'm not sure you had to make something,

291
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
but we used to make movies for kids.

292
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
And we used to call it Sprite.

293
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
We're going to wash these up a little bit.

294
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I like to wash them.

295
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I'm going to get some of the bugs out.

296
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,000
So we're going to go ahead and cut these off.

297
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
All we're going to do now.

298
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I like to cut them up.

299
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I'm going to cut them in half, y'all.

300
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Drop this half in here.

301
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I don't even know how to show me how to do this.

302
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,000
But shake them around and get them down.

303
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Show them.

304
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I like to learn.

305
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
That's so important right now.

306
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,000
It is bringing into the visible

307
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,000
what has already been declared in the invisible.

308
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Another crucial part of your preparation is forgiveness.

309
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
You cannot receive fully while holding resentments.

310
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
That person who heard you deeply,

311
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
that family member who betrayed you,

312
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
that colleague who wronged you,

313
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
you need to release them through genuine forgiveness.

314
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
I understand this.

315
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,000
They seem impossible considering the pain they caused.

316
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
But I'm not asking you to forget or to say

317
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
that what they did was right.

318
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
I'm asking you to release them from the prison of your resentment

319
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:40,000
and place the situation completely in my hands.

320
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Forgiveness is not a feeling.

321
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
It is a decision.

322
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,000
It is an act of your will that frees not only the other person,

323
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
but mainly yourself.

324
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:55,000
A miracle I have prepared requires a clean heart to fully manifest.

325
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Don't let roots of bitterness block what I'm about to do.

326
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Now do you feel that hesitation in your heart,

327
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
that fear of being disappointed again?

328
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
I understand perfectly.

329
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
You've had so many disappointed hopes,

330
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
so many promises that didn't seem to,

331
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
who come true in the time you expected.

332
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
But I want you to know that this hesitation

333
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
is not a pen to my heart.

334
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I understand you have a frailty.

335
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Remember Thomas who needed to see to believe.

336
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
My child did not condemn him.

337
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
He revealed himself to him in the way he needed.

338
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
If you are struggling with doubts,

339
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
come to me just as you are.

340
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Bring your doubts, your fears, your questions.

341
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,000
I prefer your vulnerable honesty to false certainty.

342
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Even with faith as small as a must and seed,

343
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
you can move mountains.

344
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
It's not the size of your faith that matters.

345
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
It's the object of it.

346
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
And when your faith is placed in me,

347
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
even shaky and imperfect,

348
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
it is enough to see my miracles manifest.

349
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
I want you to share with me in the comments.

350
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
What is this miracle you are waiting for?

351
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
What is this mountain that seems impossible to move?

352
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
By declaring your need,

353
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
you are taking the first step towards seeing manifestation.

354
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Now let me tell you about divine timing.

355
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
My timing rarely matches your expectations.

356
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
For you, the weight may feel like torture.

357
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,000
For me, it is the necessary process of preparation.

358
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Remember how the people of Israel wandered for 40 years

359
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
before entering the Promised Land.

360
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Those were not wasted years.

361
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
There were years of forming a national identity

362
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
of learning dependence on me

363
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
of preparing for the battles to come.

364
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Likewise, your waiting time

365
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
is not wasted time.

366
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
It's a precious time

367
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
where I'm working on levels you can't see.

368
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Preparing not just the miracle,

369
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
but preparing you for the miracle.

370
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Because you see,

371
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
sometimes the biggest challenges

372
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
and receiving the miracle,

373
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
it's keeping it.

374
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Many people have received blessings

375
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
that they were not emotionally or spiritually prepared for

376
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
and have lost them.

377
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Your waiting has a profound purpose of preparation.

378
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Have you ever wondered why Lazarus had to spend four days

379
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
in the tomb before being resurrected?

380
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Why didn't my child arrive before he died?

381
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Or at least on the first day?

382
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Because I wanted to eliminate any doubt about the miracle.

383
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
After four days, according to Jewish beliefs,

384
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
the soul had definitively departed

385
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
and decomposition was advanced.

386
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
It was humanly impossible.

387
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,000
And that is exactly where my power shines brightest.

388
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Perhaps your situation has also reached this point of human impossibility.

389
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
The doctors have already given up.

390
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Financial advisors have exhausted their options.

391
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Marriage therapists have already recommended divorce.

392
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Perfect.

393
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Now we are exactly where my supernatural power can be demonstrated

394
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
beyond a shadow of a doubt.

395
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
My child, my daughter,

396
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:13,000
you have tried to resolve this on your own for so long.

397
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,000
You have already exhausted your resources, your wisdom, your strength.

398
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Now finally, we come to the place where you can truly rest

399
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
and see my salvation manifest.

400
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,000
While you wait, cultivate peace.

401
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Not that superficial peace that depends on circumstances,

402
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
but the deep peace that comes from knowing

403
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,000
that I am in control even when everything seems chaotic.

404
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,000
It is a peace that transcends human understanding,

405
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
that guards your heart and mind,

406
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,000
even in the midst of the most violent storm.

407
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,000
And don't forget to take care of your physical being while you wait.

408
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Rest adequately.

409
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Eat well.

410
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Move your body.

411
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Sometimes we focus so much on the spiritual

412
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:06,000
that we neglect the physical temple I created for you to inhabit.

413
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Your body, mind and spirit are interconnected,

414
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:13,000
and comprehensive care is part of preparing for the miracle.

415
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
There is something else I want you to know.

416
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,000
This miracle I am preparing for you is not isolated.

417
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,000
It's part of a bigger plan that includes your family, your community,

418
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
and even people you don't know yet.

419
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:32,000
When Daniel prayed, he did not know that his prayers were moving angelic arms.

420
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,000
When Esther fasted, she did not fully understand how their actions

421
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
would save an entire nation.

422
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Likewise, your personal miracle is connected to a much greater purpose

423
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
than you can see now.

424
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,000
People will watch what I do in their lives

425
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
and find hope for their own battles.

426
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Your testimony will open doors.

427
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:59,000
This is why it is so important that you begin sharing your faith expectation

428
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
even before you see the full manifestation.

429
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Tell people what you expect me to do,

430
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
not out of vanity or presumption,

431
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
but as an act of faith that glorifies me.

432
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Remember, the enemy wants you to keep quiet about your expectations

433
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,000
so that if you don't see the miracle right away,

434
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
he can use that to shame you.

435
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Don't fall into this trap, openly declare your trust in me,

436
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,000
knowing that my word never returns void.

437
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Share in the comments what miracle are you waiting for.

438
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
What seems impossible in your life right now,

439
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,000
I will read each comment and pray as will be released on your behalf.

440
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Now let's talk about how you will know when the miracle is about to happen.

441
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:48,000
I often sense signs, little confirmations, divine coincidences,

442
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
words of knowledge through others,

443
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
keep your spiritual eyes and ears wide,

444
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,000
open often before the greatest miracle.

445
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,000
There is a period of intensifying spiritual warfare.

446
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,000
The enemy, sensing that he is about to lose ground,

447
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000
launches his fiercest attacks.

448
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Don't be alarmed if just as you are getting closer to manifestation,

449
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,000
things seem to temporarily get worse.

450
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:19,000
It's just the last spasm of darkness before the glorious door.

451
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,000
You may also notice an increase in prophetic dreams

452
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
or spiritual impressions.

453
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Pay attention to them, write them down.

454
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Compare them with my written word.

455
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Don't dismiss these subtle communications.

456
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Shit!

457
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Shit!
