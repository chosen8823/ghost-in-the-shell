0	8000	And it is exactly in these areas of greatest pain and fragility that the miracle is already taking place.
8000	12000	It's like a seed under the ground. You can't see what's happening.
12000	18000	But the most important processes are unfolding in the silence, in the darkness,
18000	22000	preparing the manifestation that will change everything.
22000	27000	You often look at the clock of your life and think it's already too late.
27000	31000	But in my kingdom, it is never too late.
31000	37000	I am the God who transforms deserts into flower gardens, who makes dry bones revive,
37000	40000	who brings back what seemed lost forever.
40000	46000	Remember Sarah, who laughed when she found out she would have a child in her old age.
46000	49000	How did my servant Abraham wait decades for the promise?
49000	53000	And yet, at the appointed time, the impossible happened.
53000	58000	The same applies to you. The pain you feel now is making room for a miracle
58000	62000	that wouldn't fit into your life otherwise. That closed.
62000	67000	You all that disappointed him so much wasn't a rejection. It was a redirection.
67000	72000	I was sparing you from paths that would divert you from your true destiny.
72000	75000	From this great miracle that I am preparing.
75000	78000	I want you to understand something fundamental.
78000	82000	My miracles are not just for solving problems.
82000	87000	They offer the purpose of revealing my glory and expanding my kingdom.
87000	91000	The miracle I am preparing is not just for your personal comfort,
91000	95000	although it will bring you unspeakable joy.
95000	99000	It has ramifications you can't even imagine.
99000	104000	Think of Lazarus, who was resurrected after four days.
104000	108000	That miracle was not just to return. And brother to Martha and Mary.
108000	113000	It was a testimony that strengthened the faith of many, and that even today,
113000	118000	thousands of years later confirms the power of my child Jesus.
118000	122000	Your miracle will also touch lives. You don't even know yet.
122000	129000	There are people designated to cross your path, who will be impacted by the story of what I am going to do in your life.
129000	135000	Your own family will see my glory through this miracle, and generations will be transformed.
135000	140000	There is an eternal purpose behind the supernatural manifestation I am preparing.
140000	145000	I know you've tried everything, he consulted experts, followed advice,
145000	152000	implemented strategies, took medications, made investments, tried new methods.
152000	155000	And it seems like nothing completely worked.
155000	160000	This is because this specific problem does not have an earthly solution.
160000	165000	It has been reserved for a demonstration of my supernatural power.
165000	169000	There are situations in life that no human effort can resolve.
169000	174000	They were designed specifically for my intervention, not to punish you,
174000	180000	but to create the perfect setting where my glory can be revealed in an unmistakable way.
180000	184000	Do you remember when my child multiplied the loads and fishes?
184000	187000	He could have just sent everyone home to get food.
187000	193000	The lack of resources created the perfect scenario for one of the most iconic miracles recorded.
193000	198000	Likewise, the limitations you face now are not obstacles to the miracle.
198000	202000	They are the stage on which it will be demonstrated.
202000	208000	Now I want you to understand the pattern that always precedes my great miracles.
208000	212000	Before liberation comes, the most intense captivity.
212000	215000	Before healing, the disease often worsens.
215000	221000	Before financial provision is made, resources are often completely exhausted.
221000	224000	Are you living in this moment right now?
224000	228000	Does it feel like everything is getting worse instead of better?
228000	232000	This is not a sign that I have abandoned you.
232000	236000	It is often the prelude to the greatest miracle.
236000	240000	It's like the darkest night before the most glorious dawn.
240000	245000	The sources and the people of Israel saw the Red Sea open only when they were trapped,
245000	249000	when the Egyptian army had their backs and the sea in front of them.
249000	256000	It was in the moment of greatest despair that my power manifested itself most dramatically.
256000	261000	You may be feeling now that you have hit rock bottom, that there is nowhere left to go,
261000	269000	and you are right, there is nowhere left to go, but up to the manifestation of the miracle that is already determined.
270000	276000	I want you to know that this is exactly the point where I begin to operate most powerfully,
276000	282000	and now let me tell you about this heavenly intercession that is taking place on your behalf.
282000	287000	There is a cloud of witnesses, people who lived on this earth before you,
287000	291000	and who are now in my presence, who rejoice to see the persistent faith.
291000	297000	You demonstrate even without seeing its conjoys people who lived on this earth with your behalf.
297000	301000	There is a part of this heaven begin to operate most powerfully,
301000	307000	and now let me tell you about this heavenly intercession that is taking place on your behalf.
307000	312000	There is a cloud of witnesses, people who lived on this earth before you,
312000	317000	and who are now in my presence, who rejoice to see the persistent faith.
317000	321000	You demonstrate even without seeing its complete fulfillment,
321000	325000	that grandmother who prayed for you before you were even born,
325000	332000	who has still alive before my throne, that has been passed and interceded for the next generation.
332000	336000	The fruit of your ministry is manifesting in your life now.
336000	341000	There is a spiritual continuity that transcends time and physical death.
341000	346000	This communion of saints is not something you should invoke or seek directly.
346000	350000	That would be overstepping the boundaries I have sent.
350000	353000	But it is a reality that should comfort your heart.
353000	357000	The prayers of the departed righteous remain effective,
357000	359000	not because they have power of their own,
359000	363000	but because they align with my perfect will for your life.
363000	366000	When you pray, know that you do not pray alone,
366000	373000	your voice joins a heavenly choir that has declared my will over your life for generations.
373000	376000	This is part of the glorious mystery of the body of Christ,
376000	379000	that transcends time and space,
379000	383000	and more than that my own child Jesus is on my right hand.
383000	385000	Continually interceding for you,
385000	388000	the Holy Spirit within you grows,
388000	390000	within expressible size,
390000	392000	when you don't even know how to pray.
392000	396000	You are enveloped in a triple projection of divine intercession.
396000	401000	Have you ever felt an inexplicable peace in the midst of solutions
401000	403000	that should have you?
403000	405000	You are in with a continuous,
405000	409000	but you declare my will over your life for generations.
409000	412000	This is part of the glorious mystery of the body of Christ,
412000	415000	that transcends time and space,
415000	419000	and more than that my own child Jesus is on my right hand.
419000	421000	Continually interceding for you,
421000	424000	the Holy Spirit within you grows,
424000	426000	within expressible size,
426000	428000	when you don't even know how to pray.
428000	432000	You are enveloped in a triple projection of divine intercession.
432000	438000	Have you ever felt an inexplicable peace in the midst of solutions?
438000	440000	Next generation,
440000	442000	with a brilliant symmetry,
442000	444000	it's a bit better.
444000	447000	This is not a sign that I have abandoned you.
447000	451000	It is often the prelude to the greatest miracle.
451000	455000	It's like the darkest night before the most glorious dawn.
455000	457000	Moses of the people of Israel
457000	460000	saw the Red Sea open only when they were trapped,
460000	462000	with the Egyptian army of their backs,
462000	464000	and the sea in front of them.
464000	467000	It was in the moment that the greatest despair
467000	471000	that might now manifest itself most dramatic.
471000	474000	You may be feeling now that you have hit rock bottom,
474000	476000	that there is nowhere left to go,
476000	478000	and you are right,
478000	480000	there is nowhere left to go,
480000	482000	but up to the manifestation of the miracle
482000	485000	that is already determined.
485000	488000	I want you to know that this is exactly the point
488000	491000	where I begin to operate most powerfully.
491000	492000	And now,
492000	495000	let me tell you about this heavenly intercession
495000	497000	that is taking place on your behalf.
497000	499000	There is a cloud of witnesses,
499000	502000	people who lived on this earth before you,
502000	504000	and who are now in my presence,
504000	506000	who rejoice to see the persistent faith.
506000	508000	You demonstrate,
508000	510000	even without seeing its complete fulfillment.
510000	512000	That grandmother who prayed for you
512000	514000	before you were even born,
514000	517000	your prayers are still alive before my throne,
517000	521000	that faithful pastor who interceded for the next generation,
521000	525000	the fruit of your ministry is manifesting in your life now.
525000	529000	There is a spiritual continuity that transcends time
529000	531000	and physical death.
531000	533000	This communion of saints is not something
533000	535000	you should invoke or seek directly.
535000	539000	That would be overstepping the boundaries I have said.
539000	542000	But it is a reality that should comfort your heart.
543000	546000	The prayers of the departed righteous remain effective,
546000	549000	not because they have power of their own,
549000	553000	but because they align with my perfect will for your life.
553000	556000	When you pray, know that you do not pray alone,
556000	558000	your voice joins a heavenly choir
558000	562000	that has declared my will over your life for generations.
562000	566000	This is part of the glorious mystery of the body of Christ
566000	569000	that transcends time and space,
569000	572000	more than that my own child Jesus is at my right hand,
572000	575000	continually interceding for you.
575000	577000	The Holy Spirit within you groans,
577000	579000	within expressible size,
579000	581000	when you don't even know how to pray.
581000	585000	You are enveloped in a triple protection of divine intercession.
585000	588000	Have you ever felt an inexplicable peace
588000	590000	in the midst of circumstances
590000	592000	that should reshatter in your spirit?
592000	596000	This is the tangible result of this heavenly intercession
596000	600000	combined with my supernatural will.
600000	603000	It is the fruit of this communion of saints
603000	606000	that process the veil between heaven and earth.
606000	608000	Now I want to tell you something practical
608000	611000	about the miracle that is about to happen.
611000	614000	It will come in a way you don't expect,
614000	616000	in a way you don't imagine.
616000	620000	My greatest miracles often come disguised in surprising ways.
620000	622000	Joseph awaited in prison,
622000	626000	not knowing that he was a dream away from the palace.
626000	629000	Esther was a simple young Jewish girl
629000	631000	without imagining that she would be queen
631000	633000	and save an entire nation.
633000	638000	David was just a shepherd when he was appointed to begin.
638000	642000	Your miracle probably won't come wrapped up the way you expect.
642000	647000	It can come through someone you would never imagine.
647000	650000	In a way that defies your expectations,
650000	653000	that's why it's so important to keep your heart open
653000	655000	and your eyes attentive.
655000	657000	Many people have missed their miracles
657000	660000	because they were looking in the wrong direction.
660000	664000	They were so fixated on how they thought the answer would come
664000	667000	that they didn't recognize when it came differently.
667000	669000	Don't make that mistake, son.
669000	673000	If you are looking for a fuller and more fulfilled life,
673000	676000	divine dialogue is the perfect tool for you.
676000	679000	With powerful techniques and clear instructions,
679000	684000	you can achieve the peace and personal fulfillment you've always wanted.
684000	686000	Don't waste any more time.
686000	688000	Access the link in the pinned comment
688000	692000	and take the first step towards a better life.
692000	696000	Your part now is to prepare to receive
696000	700000	as cultivating an attitude of expectation and gratitude.
700000	704000	Start giving thanks for the miracle before you even see it.
704000	706000	This is not...
712000	716000	The peace and personal fulfillment you've always wanted.
716000	718000	Don't waste any more time.
718000	721000	Access the link in the pinned comment
721000	725000	and take the first step towards a better life.
725000	728000	Your part now is to prepare to receive
728000	733000	as cultivating an attitude of expectation and gratitude.
733000	737000	Start giving thanks for the miracle before you even see it.
737000	739000	This is not denial of reality.
739000	742000	It is the highest expression of faith.
742000	745000	When my child Jesus, before the tomb of Lazarus,
745000	748000	gave thanks before seeing the miracle,
748000	753000	he was demonstrating the most powerful principle of the kingdom,
753000	755000	gratitude in advance.
755000	758000	Start giving thanks for the miracle as if it had already happened
758000	762000	because in heavenly reality it has already happened.
762000	766000	Talk about your miracle in the present tense.
766000	768000	Don't say, God will heal me.
768000	773000	Say, I thank you because I am healed by His wounds.
773000	776000	Don't say, I hope God restores my marriage.
776000	779000	Say, I thank God for the complete restoration
779000	781000	He has already accomplished in my home.
781000	783000	This is not a positive thinking technique.
783000	787000	It is alignment with the spiritual reality
787000	790000	that already exists in the kingdom.
822000	833000	If you can create a feeling in your heart,
833000	835000	0.1 hurts.
835000	838000	The math feeling is going to harmonize your heart and your brain.
838000	839000	Precepts.
839000	840000	Frit?
840000	842000	It's no glyco.
842000	844000	It's no glyco.
844000	845000	Disapair entry.
845000	846000	You with pan.
846000	847000	Needles.
847000	848000	I'm not sure you have a makes up.
848000	849000	We used to make movies.
849000	851000	We used to call it Sprite.
852000	854000	We're going to wash these up a little bit.
854000	856000	I like to wash them.
856000	858000	I'm going to get some of the bugs out.
858000	862000	So we're going to go ahead and cut these off.
862000	865000	All we're going to do now.
865000	868000	I like to cut them up.
868000	872000	I'm going to cut them in half, y'all.
872000	876000	Drop this half in here.
876000	879000	I don't even know who showed me how to do this.
880000	882000	Take them away.
882000	885000	I don't get them down.
885000	886000	Sugar.
891000	894000	I like to cook one.
894000	897000	Two.
897000	900000	Three.
900000	902000	Four.
902000	906000	A little bit more.
906000	910000	Next thing, all you do is put water in.
910000	913000	Always put it to the top.
921000	925000	I like to shake it up.
925000	927000	Get that sugar melting.
927000	929000	See the sugar is all on the bottom here.
929000	930000	Get it all melted.
930000	933000	And what happens when the sugar permeates?
933000	935000	The sugar permeates with the pan.
935000	938000	So the pan will put off yeast and make it permeate.
938000	941000	And once it does that, that's what makes it like carbonation.
941000	944000	It makes it taste like the first one.
944000	945000	All right, y'all.
945000	946000	We got them all made up.
946000	948000	Yeah, we got to do it hurry up and wait again.
948000	951000	Seems like everything I do, I got to hurry up and wait.
951000	955000	We're going to let this sit here for about three, four days.
955000	956000	All right, y'all.
956000	957000	It's been about four, five days.
957000	959000	We've been waiting.
959000	960000	We've heard it pop.
960000	962000	That means it's ready.
963000	965000	OK, now we've got fans.
965000	968000	And now I've got a little strainer.
968000	970000	Well, when it's heated, we didn't handle strainer.
970000	972000	We just drank it straight from the jar.
972000	974000	OK, we're going to dump something in here.
974000	975000	Sure, y'all.
975000	977000	Y'all see all the fans on the top?
977000	979000	See that?
979000	981000	Oh, smells so good.
981000	982000	All right, y'all.
982000	985000	Catch a few of the needles.
985000	987000	All right.
987000	989000	Y'all the fans in there, y'all.
989000	991000	And y'all see that?
993000	995000	Yeah, I got some little tasting cups here.
995000	998000	Well, I'm fans of the day, I know.
1001000	1004000	Bring back childhood memory.
1004000	1007000	Childhood memory, you see it.
1007000	1008000	It's really good.
1008000	1010000	This looked like a disappearing tree.
1010000	1011000	You were fine, needle.
1011000	1013000	I'm not sure you had to make something,
1013000	1015000	but we used to make movies for kids.
1015000	1017000	And we used to call it Sprite.
1017000	1019000	We're going to wash these up a little bit.
1019000	1021000	I like to wash them.
1021000	1023000	I'm going to get some of the bugs out.
1023000	1027000	So we're going to go ahead and cut these off.
1027000	1030000	All we're going to do now.
1030000	1033000	I like to cut them up.
1033000	1037000	I'm going to cut them in half, y'all.
1037000	1042000	Drop this half in here.
1042000	1045000	I don't even know how to show me how to do this.
1045000	1049000	But shake them around and get them down.
1050000	1052000	Show them.
1056000	1059000	I like to learn.
1074000	1076000	That's so important right now.
1077000	1081000	It is bringing into the visible
1081000	1085000	what has already been declared in the invisible.
1085000	1089000	Another crucial part of your preparation is forgiveness.
1089000	1092000	You cannot receive fully while holding resentments.
1092000	1094000	That person who heard you deeply,
1094000	1096000	that family member who betrayed you,
1096000	1098000	that colleague who wronged you,
1098000	1101000	you need to release them through genuine forgiveness.
1101000	1103000	I understand this.
1103000	1107000	They seem impossible considering the pain they caused.
1107000	1110000	But I'm not asking you to forget or to say
1110000	1112000	that what they did was right.
1112000	1115000	I'm asking you to release them from the prison of your resentment
1115000	1120000	and place the situation completely in my hands.
1120000	1122000	Forgiveness is not a feeling.
1122000	1124000	It is a decision.
1124000	1128000	It is an act of your will that frees not only the other person,
1128000	1130000	but mainly yourself.
1130000	1135000	A miracle I have prepared requires a clean heart to fully manifest.
1135000	1139000	Don't let roots of bitterness block what I'm about to do.
1139000	1142000	Now do you feel that hesitation in your heart,
1142000	1145000	that fear of being disappointed again?
1145000	1147000	I understand perfectly.
1147000	1149000	You've had so many disappointed hopes,
1149000	1152000	so many promises that didn't seem to,
1152000	1155000	who come true in the time you expected.
1155000	1157000	But I want you to know that this hesitation
1157000	1160000	is not a pen to my heart.
1160000	1163000	I understand you have a frailty.
1163000	1166000	Remember Thomas who needed to see to believe.
1166000	1168000	My child did not condemn him.
1168000	1171000	He revealed himself to him in the way he needed.
1171000	1173000	If you are struggling with doubts,
1173000	1175000	come to me just as you are.
1175000	1179000	Bring your doubts, your fears, your questions.
1179000	1183000	I prefer your vulnerable honesty to false certainty.
1183000	1186000	Even with faith as small as a must and seed,
1186000	1188000	you can move mountains.
1188000	1191000	It's not the size of your faith that matters.
1191000	1192000	It's the object of it.
1192000	1195000	And when your faith is placed in me,
1195000	1197000	even shaky and imperfect,
1197000	1200000	it is enough to see my miracles manifest.
1200000	1203000	I want you to share with me in the comments.
1203000	1206000	What is this miracle you are waiting for?
1206000	1209000	What is this mountain that seems impossible to move?
1209000	1211000	By declaring your need,
1211000	1214000	you are taking the first step towards seeing manifestation.
1214000	1217000	Now let me tell you about divine timing.
1217000	1220000	My timing rarely matches your expectations.
1220000	1223000	For you, the weight may feel like torture.
1223000	1227000	For me, it is the necessary process of preparation.
1227000	1231000	Remember how the people of Israel wandered for 40 years
1231000	1233000	before entering the Promised Land.
1233000	1236000	Those were not wasted years.
1236000	1239000	There were years of forming a national identity
1239000	1241000	of learning dependence on me
1241000	1244000	of preparing for the battles to come.
1244000	1247000	Likewise, your waiting time
1247000	1249000	is not wasted time.
1249000	1251000	It's a precious time
1251000	1254000	where I'm working on levels you can't see.
1254000	1256000	Preparing not just the miracle,
1256000	1258000	but preparing you for the miracle.
1258000	1260000	Because you see,
1260000	1262000	sometimes the biggest challenges
1262000	1264000	and receiving the miracle,
1264000	1265000	it's keeping it.
1265000	1268000	Many people have received blessings
1268000	1271000	that they were not emotionally or spiritually prepared for
1271000	1272000	and have lost them.
1272000	1276000	Your waiting has a profound purpose of preparation.
1276000	1279000	Have you ever wondered why Lazarus had to spend four days
1279000	1281000	in the tomb before being resurrected?
1281000	1284000	Why didn't my child arrive before he died?
1284000	1286000	Or at least on the first day?
1286000	1290000	Because I wanted to eliminate any doubt about the miracle.
1290000	1293000	After four days, according to Jewish beliefs,
1293000	1296000	the soul had definitively departed
1296000	1299000	and decomposition was advanced.
1299000	1301000	It was humanly impossible.
1301000	1305000	And that is exactly where my power shines brightest.
1305000	1310000	Perhaps your situation has also reached this point of human impossibility.
1310000	1313000	The doctors have already given up.
1313000	1316000	Financial advisors have exhausted their options.
1316000	1320000	Marriage therapists have already recommended divorce.
1320000	1321000	Perfect.
1321000	1325000	Now we are exactly where my supernatural power can be demonstrated
1325000	1327000	beyond a shadow of a doubt.
1327000	1329000	My child, my daughter,
1329000	1333000	you have tried to resolve this on your own for so long.
1333000	1337000	You have already exhausted your resources, your wisdom, your strength.
1337000	1341000	Now finally, we come to the place where you can truly rest
1341000	1344000	and see my salvation manifest.
1344000	1348000	While you wait, cultivate peace.
1348000	1351000	Not that superficial peace that depends on circumstances,
1351000	1354000	but the deep peace that comes from knowing
1354000	1358000	that I am in control even when everything seems chaotic.
1358000	1362000	It is a peace that transcends human understanding,
1362000	1364000	that guards your heart and mind,
1364000	1368000	even in the midst of the most violent storm.
1368000	1372000	And don't forget to take care of your physical being while you wait.
1372000	1374000	Rest adequately.
1374000	1376000	Eat well.
1376000	1378000	Move your body.
1378000	1381000	Sometimes we focus so much on the spiritual
1381000	1386000	that we neglect the physical temple I created for you to inhabit.
1386000	1389000	Your body, mind and spirit are interconnected,
1389000	1393000	and comprehensive care is part of preparing for the miracle.
1393000	1396000	There is something else I want you to know.
1396000	1400000	This miracle I am preparing for you is not isolated.
1400000	1404000	It's part of a bigger plan that includes your family, your community,
1404000	1407000	and even people you don't know yet.
1407000	1412000	When Daniel prayed, he did not know that his prayers were moving angelic arms.
1412000	1416000	When Esther fasted, she did not fully understand how their actions
1416000	1418000	would save an entire nation.
1418000	1423000	Likewise, your personal miracle is connected to a much greater purpose
1423000	1425000	than you can see now.
1425000	1428000	People will watch what I do in their lives
1428000	1431000	and find hope for their own battles.
1431000	1433000	Your testimony will open doors.
1434000	1439000	This is why it is so important that you begin sharing your faith expectation
1439000	1442000	even before you see the full manifestation.
1442000	1445000	Tell people what you expect me to do,
1445000	1447000	not out of vanity or presumption,
1447000	1450000	but as an act of faith that glorifies me.
1450000	1455000	Remember, the enemy wants you to keep quiet about your expectations
1455000	1458000	so that if you don't see the miracle right away,
1458000	1460000	he can use that to shame you.
1460000	1464000	Don't fall into this trap, openly declare your trust in me,
1464000	1467000	knowing that my word never returns void.
1467000	1471000	Share in the comments what miracle are you waiting for.
1471000	1474000	What seems impossible in your life right now,
1474000	1478000	I will read each comment and pray as will be released on your behalf.
1478000	1483000	Now let's talk about how you will know when the miracle is about to happen.
1483000	1488000	I often sense signs, little confirmations, divine coincidences,
1489000	1491000	words of knowledge through others,
1491000	1494000	keep your spiritual eyes and ears wide,
1494000	1498000	open often before the greatest miracle.
1498000	1502000	There is a period of intensifying spiritual warfare.
1502000	1505000	The enemy, sensing that he is about to lose ground,
1505000	1508000	launches his fiercest attacks.
1508000	1511000	Don't be alarmed if just as you are getting closer to manifestation,
1511000	1514000	things seem to temporarily get worse.
1514000	1519000	It's just the last spasm of darkness before the glorious door.
1519000	1522000	You may also notice an increase in prophetic dreams
1522000	1524000	or spiritual impressions.
1524000	1526000	Pay attention to them, write them down.
1526000	1529000	Compare them with my written word.
1529000	1532000	Don't dismiss these subtle communications.
1532000	1533000	Shit!
1574000	1576000	Shit!
