    Introduction to Quantum-Classical Hybrid Computing Systems
    
    As quantum computing technology matures, researchers are increasingly focused on hybrid 
    systems that combine quantum and classical processing capabilities. These hybrid architectures 
    leverage the strengths of both paradigms to solve complex computational problems that are 
    intractable for purely classical or quantum systems alone.
    
    The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) represents a promising approach for 
    near-term quantum devices. QAOA alternates between quantum and classical processing steps, 
    using quantum circuits to prepare trial states and classical optimization to adjust parameters.
    This hybrid approach has shown particular promise for combinatorial optimization problems.
    
    Error mitigation techniques in quantum computing include zero-noise extrapolation, 
    randomized compiling, and symmetry verification. These methods help reduce the impact 
    of quantum noise without requiring full quantum error correction, making them suitable 
    for current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices.
    
    Variational Quantum Eigensolvers (VQE) use quantum computers to prepare quantum states 
    while classical computers optimize the parameters. This approach has applications in 
    quantum chemistry, materials science, and condensed matter physics.
    
    Classical post-processing algorithms can enhance quantum measurement results through 
    statistical analysis and error correction codes. Machine learning techniques are 
    increasingly used to improve quantum state tomography and parameter estimation.
    
    The integration of quantum and classical systems requires careful consideration of 
    communication latency, classical processing overhead, and the optimal division of 
    computational tasks between quantum and classical components.
