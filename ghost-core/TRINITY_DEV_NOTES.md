Trinity Dev Notes
=================

Status (2025-08-21)
- All Trinity launcher tests passing locally: 6/6 ✅
- Key fixes applied:
  - `agents/memory_arm.py` — indentation and Markdown fence removal; safe persistence and stable JSON hashing for memory IDs
  - `bus/conductor.py` — minimal Python shim added to allow `trinity_system` import and tests; TypeScript conductor remains in `bus/conductor.ts` as canonical implementation

How to run tests
1. Activate venv (Windows PowerShell):

```powershell
& "C:\Users\chose\ghost in the shell\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1"
cd "C:\Users\chose\ghost in the shell\ghost-core"
python trinity_launcher.py test
```

2. Run a single arm self-test (memory arm):

```powershell
cd "C:\Users\chose\ghost in the shell\ghost-core\agents"
python memory_arm.py
```

Notes on conductor
- A lightweight Python shim (`bus/conductor.py`) was added solely to enable tests and local orchestration in Python.
- The original TS implementation lives in `bus/conductor.ts`. If you plan to run production orchestration in TypeScript, keep the TS file and remove/ignore the Python shim.

Recommended next steps (pick one):
1) Packaging / Installer (Windows): create a `requirements.txt`, a PyInstaller spec, and an InnoSetup script to produce a `setup.exe` that bundles Sophia and optional deps.
2) Harden Memory Arm: add type hints, unit tests for store/retrieve/search, and migrate from the simple fallback to the full memory implementation if desired.
3) Replace shim with full Python Conductor: port conductor.ts logic into a robust Python `bus/conductor.py` implementation with security policy enforcement and queueing.
4) Create a small developer README + CHANGES and commit the changes (I can create a PR or branch if you want).

Tell me which of these to do next, or I can start with (1) Packaging by default.
